  Open Ownership is a non-profit run by a small, expert team well positioned to
  support countries implementing beneficial ownership transparency (BOT). Our
  day-to-day management relies on an executive team who are overseen by a
  Steering Group made up of leading transparency and accountability organisations.

  In order to focus on our mission, Open Ownership is fiscally sponsored by
  [Global Impact](https://charity.org/fiscal-sponsorship).
  [Fiscal sponsorship](https://charity.org/fiscal-sponsorship) is a common
  mechanism in the non-profit sector
  that enables organisations to launch new programmes without needing to complete
  the full process of establishing a new legal entity.

  The Steering Group and our partners help ensure that our organisation is
  strategic and focused on our mission. The Steering Group also contributes to
  fundraising and publicly champions BOT.
partners-text: We work with partners worldwide in governments, businesses, civil society
  organisations, academia, and the media to bring ownership information into the open.
