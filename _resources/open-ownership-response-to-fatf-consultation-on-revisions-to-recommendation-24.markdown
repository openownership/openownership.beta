Open Ownership’s contribution to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) consultation on revisions to its Recommendation 24 on beneficial ownership transparency. This response focuses on why mandating centralised registries as part of a multi-pronged approach is the most effective way to achieve FATF’s objectives by ensuring actors fighting financial crime have timely access to accurate beneficial ownership data.
