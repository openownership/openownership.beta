This briefing sets out how BOT can help mitigate a range of national security threats from state and non-state actors by integrating structured and interoperable BO information with other data sources, and making this available to a range of different actors to effectively counter security threats. Impact requires the data to be usable and used, and may need complementary legislation which the data can help monitor and enforce.
