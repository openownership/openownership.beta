This report summarizes findings from Open Ownership’s scoping study into
beneficial ownership transparency in Armenia in 2020. We provide a detailed
assessment of Armenia’s BO regime, analysing current and planned reforms
against OO’s principles of effective BO disclosure. The issues and
recommendations in this report will also be relevant to other EITI countries,
particularly those using sectoral disclosures as a pilot for economy-wide
systems.
