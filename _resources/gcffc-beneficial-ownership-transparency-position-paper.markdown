This paper outlines the Global Coalition to Fight Financial Crime's (GCFFC) position on beneficial ownership transparency. Open Ownership is a member of the GCFFC. As part of its objectives to promote more effective information sharing between public and private entities, and to propose mechanisms to identify emerging threats and best practice approaches to more robust controls against money laundering, the GCFFC believes that all actors fighting financial crime should have instant access to high quality, highly usable beneficial ownership data.
