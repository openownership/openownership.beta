Slovakia was among the first countries in the world to implement a public
beneficial ownership register and is a member of the Beneficial Ownership
Leadership Group. Slovakian public beneficial ownership data was used to
expose alleged cases of wrongdoing. Reaching this point required the
Slovakian government to overcome challenges in that process, with practical
lessons for other states implementing beneficial ownership transparency. This
report provides details of Slovakia's approach and case studies of the impact
it has had.
