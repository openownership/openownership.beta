In 2015, Ukraine became the first country in the world to launch a public register of the beneficial owners of corporate entities registered in the country. This report provides an overview of the register’s origins and evolution, then explores its impact. It finds that Ukraine’s open register has enabled organisations outside the government to evaluate the quality of the register’s data, to reach insights that support the country’s anti-corruption agenda, to add value for the private sector, and to provide greater oversight of the extractive industry.
