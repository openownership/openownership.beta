In 2016 the UK became one of the first countries to
create a public register of the beneficial owners of
companies. The UK register, called the register
of Persons with Significant Control (PSC), has both
demonstrated the feasibility of public registers and
set new standards in publishing the data as open
data, allowing others to analyse the data in bulk.
While the UK register has been pioneering, there is
much that can be learnt - both to improve the UK
register and for others considering or establishing
public beneficial ownership registers.
