Annotation is an [Optional Feature](/visualisation/optional) of BOVS Diagrams. It allows you to label Arrows to be more specific about the relationships they represent.

## Appearance

![BOVS Diagram with Annotations](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation.png){: style="width: 62.5%" }

Annotations are text labels that appear alongside Arrows. They may appear at the start, middle or end of the Arrow; whatever is unambiguous and the clearest in each situation (this is usually the start).

### Interest Arrows

Where the relationship is an interest, the annotation label is written in a standard way:

* The nature of interest is given in the active voice, e.g. "Owns" or "Controls"
* The strength of interest is given as a percentage, e.g. "10%".

Annotations respect the [Chirality](/visualisation/core/chirality) rule, that is:

* Annotations about ownership appear on the left/below Arrows
* Annotations about control appear on the right/above Arrows

### Relationship Arrows

Where the relationship is not an interest, the annotation label should be written in the active voice. For instance, an Arrow connecting a mother and daughter, which proceeds from the mother to to the daughter, would mean "is the mother of", and could be labelled "Mother".

You might also choose to use an icon instead of text, in which case you should include a key.

Non-interest annotations can be written on either side of the Arrow.


## Detail Level

Interest Annotations across your diagram must use a consistent detail level. Annotations may either *qualify* interests or additionally *quantify* them. In most cases, you should prefer to provide full detail, that is, to quantify interests.

### Qualifying Interests

Annotations indicate if the nature of interest is ownership, control or both; but they do not indicate the strength of interest.

![BOVS Diagram with Annotations Qualifying Interests](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation-qualified.png){: style="width: 100%" }

If your diagram also has an [Interest Focus](/visualisation/core/focus-depth), omit all annotations except those to mark Unknown or Unquantifiable interests (see below).

### Quantifying Interests

Annotations additionally indicate the strength of ownership or control.

If your diagram also has an [Interest Focus](/visualisation/core/focus-depth), omit the nature of interest and write the strength (percentage) only.

## Relevance

![BOVS Diagram showing Annotation applied only to relevant Arrows](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation-relevance.png){: style="width: 100%" }

All [relevant](/visualisation/core/relevance) interests in your diagram must be annotated.

* Annotations should not be added to non-relevant interests.
* Omission of an annotation (of a relevant Arrow) means absence of interest.
  * e.g. if there is no annotation on the side of the Arrow where ownership information appears, it means there is no ownership interest.


## Indirect Arrows

![BOVS Diagram with Indirect Arrow](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation-indirect.png){: style="width: 100%" }

You may choose to add interest Arrows that connect distant Parties, and annotate these. These are Indirect Arrows.

* Indirect Arrows are drawn with a dotted or dashed line.
* This Arrow must be annotated with the [compounded interest](/visualisation/core/summarisation) of the first Party in the last.


## Stacks

If a [Stack](/visualisation/core/stacks) appears at a Node you are considering to be [relevant](/visualisation/core/relevance), you must annotate the Node with a [summary](/visualisation/core/summarisation) of the interests within the Stack. This ensures the interest flow along the Chain remains clear.

Where an **Entity Stack** appears along a relevant Chain:

![BOVS Diagram with Annotated Entity Stack](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation-stack-entity.png){: style="width: 100%" }

* Add a disconnected Indirect Arrow, floating beside the Entity Stack, parallel to the Arrows leading into/out of it.
  * Add an Arrow for each nature of interest present inside the Stack (i.e. ownership or control).
  * Add these Arrows on the appropriate sides of the Node, respecting the [Chirality](/visualisation/core/chirality) rule.
* Label these Arrows with the [compounded interests](/visualisation/core/summarisation) of the Parties within the Stack.

Where a **Owner Stack** appears along a relevant Chain:

![BOVS Diagram with Annotated Owner Stack](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation-stack-owner.png){: style="width: 100%" }

* Draw the Arrow from the Owner Stack as an Indirect Arrow (see above).
* Label this with the [combined interests](/visualisation/core/summarisation) of the Parties in the Stack.


## Obscured Interests

### Unknown Nature

![BOVS Diagram with Annotations for interests that are unknown in nature](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation-unknown-nature.png){: style="width: 100%" }

If the **nature** of interest is unknown:

* Write '?' on the appropriate side of the Arrow, respecting the [Chirality](/visualisation/core/chirality) rule, if it is not known whether the interest includes control, or it is not known whether the interest includes ownership.
* If the nature of interest is completely unknown, write a '?' on both sides of the Arrow.

### Unknown Strength

![BOVS Diagram with Annotations for unknown strengths of interest](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation-unknown-strength.png){: style="width: 75%" }

If the **strength** of interest is unknown, and you are quantifying interests:

* Write '?%' on the appropriate side of the Arrow.
* Donâ€™t skip the '%'. Otherwise it looks like the nature is in question, not the strength.

### Uncertain Strength

![BOVS Diagram with Annotations for uncertain strength of interest](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation-uncertain-strength.png){: style="width: 75%" }

If the strength has **uncertainty** in it:

* Write a percentage range, e.g. "Owns 10-15%", "Controls 50-100%".

### Unquantifiable Interest

![BOVS Diagram with Annotations for interests that are unquantifiable](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation-unquantifiable.png){: style="width: 75%" }

If there is an **unquantifiable** interest:

* In place of a textual annotation, or alongside one, show an icon.
* Use a different icon for each type of unquantifiable interest in your diagram.
* Include a key in your diagram offering information about each type of unquantifiable interest.
