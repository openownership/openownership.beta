Open Ownership wants to relaunch its website - https://www.openownership.org. We want to ensure that all the information and resources we produce are easily discoverable, accessible and navigable to users worldwide. 

We are looking for a thoughtful and user-focussed contractor or agency to support our site’s redevelopment. The final result should, above all else, ensure that the work we do is highly accessible and easy to navigate. For us that means ensuring that all users, and particularly those from parts of the world where internet connectivity is slower or more expensive, can access the information we produce easily. Like many organisations, our work has often ended up a little locked away in PDFs as research reports and the like - this makes it hard to access and share, and in particular, hard to translate using browser-based translation tools. Solving this challenge is really important for us.

Open Ownership is always an extremely busy organisation and this year is no different. We realise that building the new online presence for the organisation isn’t something that we can just outsource and forget about, but we want to be led by whoever we appoint. So we really want to hear from contractors or agencies who can bring well-structured thinking to how we create simple workflows through the site. This will allow our users to  quickly and easily get to the research, advice and guidance we work hard to produce. We want to carry out this project between September 2021 and the end of March 2022, and the tender budget should not exceed £45,000.

We know that early engagement with potential suppliers really helps make a contract work, so please get in touch with us to talk more about this opportunity if you would like to. We’ll update this page with any questions asked, and the answers we give. The deadline for the submission of tenders is midnight BST on Sunday 15 August 2021.

## Q&As

### Does the £45k budget include or exclude VAT?

All quotes should be inclusive of VAT and the budget should not exceed £45,500 GBP.

### How many agencies are pitching and how many will you invite for an interview?

We've had five people get in contact so far expressing interest but I'm not sure how many will do final pitches. We'll probably invite two or three for interview.

### What are the must haves for the pitch? e.g. are you expecting creative ideas and details analysis as well as the normal credentials from the winning agency?

Details about any user research experience you have / past projects delivered by your agencies.

### Who is the final decision maker for this project?

Stephen Abbott Pugh, Data and Technology Manager for Open Ownership

### For the research part of the project, who will source the participants for surveys, focus groups and interviews etc? Your organisation or the agency? Also, how many participants are you expecting?

Open Ownership would work with the successful agency to connect with users to line up their participation in the user research sessions but we would take guidance from the agency on the best way to go about signing them up.

### Does OO have a methodology to use for user research or will it ask the agency to lead on that?

We do not have a chosen methodology and would work with the successful organisation to work out what would work best

### Would using Wordpress or Drupal be a deal breaker in terms of a tech solution for this project?

Agencies can pitch any technical approach within the criteria of the call for tenders so a pitch focused on Wordpress or Drupal would not be a deal breaker.

### Are there any websites you think emulate well what you're hoping to achieve? Please share up to 3.

* <https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/>
* <https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/>
* <https://iatistandard.org/en/>

### Who are your top three competitors?

* Open Corporates <https://opencorporates.com/>
* Open Contracting Partnership <https://www.open-contracting.org/>
* Arachnys <https://www.arachnys.com>

### For the website development, do you wish for it to be redeveloped as a static website, or can we suggest another workaround, like a server site render website for example?

You can suggest another technical approach.

### Regarding the automatic translation, is your expectation we can use automatic translation from the browser?

No. We work with professional translators for our work so would instead like to introduce functionality on our site to host manually provided translations. We have experience working with technical systems like [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) to achieve this which support the use of .xliff translation files that are widely used by translation teams.

### For user research, who will provide the list of users/respondents that we will interact with?

Open Ownership will provide the list of users or we will work with the successful agency/team on the best way to recruit people for user testing.

### Does the website have an integration with other systems? Would you mind elaborating on it?

Our website is a static site, generated by Jekyll and then served by Netlify. The canonical storage is in Github and we use Siteleaf as a CMS. We also use different systems to run subdomains for register.openownership.org and standard.openownership.org but those website are not within the remit of this call for tenders.

### And for the website development, do we need to comply with existing technical requirements? such as Jekyll, Netlify? Or can we propose another technical specification?

You can propose another technical specification.

### Can we have access to Google Analytics to review site usage?

Yes.

### With regards to the Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System (BOVS) - What would you like for the use/embedding of diagrams on the site? Will these be images or something more comprehensive?

At least to start with, any BOVS diagrams used in our reports on the site will be static images but it would be good to follow an approach which would allow iterative improvements in future to allow use of interactive diagrams or embedded media like videos or data visualisation tools.

### How many languages will be required for i18n? E.g. English, Spanish...?

At present, we have [resources](https://www.openownership.org/resources/) translated into English, Spanish, Russian and Bahasa Indonesia. There is also a desire for us to do French translations soon. It would be good to focus on these languages within the remit of this project but create a process by which additional languages could be used on the website.

### Please can your team create Markdown versions of your reports and resources on Github for us to review?

As part of the website redevelopment work, we will be happy to create Markdown versions of our reports and resources for use by the successful agency. But we will not be able to do this for all resources before the end of the call for tenders. Some of our resources are already available as Markdown via our website Github repo include the [Open Ownership Principles](https://github.com/openownership/openownership.beta/tree/master/_principles) and our [Guide to implementing beneficial ownership transparency](https://github.com/openownership/openownership.beta/tree/master/_guide).
