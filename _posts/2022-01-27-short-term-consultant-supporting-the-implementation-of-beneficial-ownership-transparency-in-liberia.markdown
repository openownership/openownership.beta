Opening Extractives (OE) is a programme launched by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and Open Ownership to enhance beneficial ownership transparency. OE is seeking a consultant to support their work implementing beneficial ownership transparency in Liberia. This will entail supporting the OE team and the Steering Committee in Liberia with the implementation of the OE programmeâ€™s work-plan. The objective is to improve government and company disclosures; move towards systematic disclosure of data on beneficial ownership (first in the extractive sector, then in other sectors); and build capacity among key stakeholders in collecting, disclosing, and analysing beneficial ownership information.

Applications are due 7 February 2022.
