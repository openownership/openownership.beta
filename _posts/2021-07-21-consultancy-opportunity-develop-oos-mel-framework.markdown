Open Ownership is in the process of developing a three year strategy, covering the period 2021-24. The strategy articulates three key outcomes that the organisation will work to achieve over this timeframe, and defines work streams through which Open Ownership will deliver against these.

We now seek an experienced MEL agent (an organisation or independent consultant) to support us as we finalise this strategy and develop an MEL framework. The full terms of reference are available here, and the deadline for submission is midnight BST on 15 August 2021.
