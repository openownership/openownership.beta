The Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and Open Ownership, through their joint Programme [Opening Extractives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCUeu1F7mJE) (OE) and in collaboration with Ghana’s Registrar General Department and the Ghana Opening Extractives National Steering Committee, will be conducting a series of capacity-building and training sessions for Ghana-based civil society organisations (CSOs) and journalists during February and March 2022. The capacity-building and training sessions are aimed at raising awareness on the importance of quality and timely beneficial ownership (BO) data, and sharing skills, tools and methodologies to  analyse and use BO data.

Additionally, participants will also be able to submit research proposals which could be funded by the OE programme and should then be delivered before August 2022.

You can find out all the information in the document linked below. It contains an outline of the capacity-building sessions and key dates ahead.
