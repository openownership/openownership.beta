Together with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), Open Ownership has recently launched Opening Extractives, an ambitious global programme aiming to transform the availability and use of beneficial ownership information for effective governance in the extractive sector (mining, oil, and gas).

To support the initial work in Senegal, we are seeking a short-term contractor, either an organisation or an independent consultant, to conduct desk research, interviews, and develop a scoping study report that will help identify concrete opportunities for Open Ownership and the EITI to provide technical assistance that furthers Beneficial Ownership Transparency in Senegal.

Due to the short timeframe, we will accept applications on an ongoing basis until a contractor is appointed. At that point we will remove the advertisement.
