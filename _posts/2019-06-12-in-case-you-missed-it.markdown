It’s been an exhilarating month for us at OpenOwnership. So much has happened that we thought we’d showcase the key events in this blog post.

Three members of our team attended the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Summit in Ottawa, which brought together a diverse collection of voices from government, civil society and the private sector to discuss growing global norms in open government.

Beneficial ownership transparency featured prominently, with governments across the world acknowledging the need to end the damage caused by anonymously-owned companies and making significant commitments towards this. We’re excited about the impact this will have in advancing trust, improving the social contract between companies, governments and citizens, and supporting the integrity of companies and stability of economies globally.

In case you missed it, here’s some highlights from the conference, our work and the beneficial ownership transparency sector more generally.

# **At OGP**

## The Beneficial Ownership Leadership Group

John Penrose, the UK Prime Minister’s Anti-Corruption Champion launched a [Beneficial Ownership Leadership Group](https://www.openownership.org/news/new-at-the-ogp-summit-openownership-and-uk-government-launch-a-major-collective-action-platform-and-we-scale-up-our-help-for-implementers/). This transnational coalition of governments will drive a global policy shift towards free, open beneficial ownership data and set ambitious best practice. OpenOwnership will coordinate key Leadership Group activities, facilitate discussions on international best practice and produce related guidance. To date, Argentina, Latvia, Norway, Kenya, Finland, Slovakia, Ukraine and Armenia have joined the group, with Mexico, Nigeria and Indonesia likely to join in the autumn

## A Guide to Implementing Beneficial Ownership Transparency

We’re delighted to launch a new product, [A Guide to Implementing Beneficial Ownership Transparency](https://www.openownership.org/guide/) to support the Leadership Group and other governments implementing beneficial ownership transparency. The guide supports all stages of the implementation journey from commitment through to publication and is complemented by a set of technical tools for implementers.

You can learn more about both the Leadership Group and Guide [here](https://www.openownership.org/news/new-at-the-ogp-summit-openownership-and-uk-government-launch-a-major-collective-action-platform-and-we-scale-up-our-help-for-implementers/).

## An Award from MDTF

We’re proud to have been awarded a grant from the OGP Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for advancing OGP’s thematic priority in the field of Beneficial Ownership. We will form part of the first ever cohort of awardees for this [program](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/stories/stronger-open-government-advancing-ogps-thematic-priorities/). We will use this award to scale our impact across the globe.

## Launch of State of Open Data Book

The book [State of Open Data](https://www.stateofopendata.od4d.net/) was launched by [Open Data for Development](https://www.od4d.net/) (OD4D) with Jack Lord, from our technical partner-Open Data Services Co-operative, contributing a chapter on [Corporate Ownership](https://www.stateofopendata.od4d.net/chapters/sectors/corporate-ownership.html).
