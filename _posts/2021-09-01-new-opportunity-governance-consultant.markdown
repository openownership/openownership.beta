Open Ownership has been a fiscally-sponsored entity since its inception more than 5 years ago. Having grown and matured over that time, we are now looking into establishing ourselves as an independently registered non-profit in the UK. Could you help us through these steps?

We seek a short-term contractor, either an organisation or an independent consultant, to support this work to develop and lead the establishment of Open Ownership as an independent and employer entity in the UK. The successful contractor will be responsible for leading the development and implementation of our roadmap to organisational independence working very closely with the Senior Management Team.
