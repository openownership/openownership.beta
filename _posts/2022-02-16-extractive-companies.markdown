As part of our Opening Extractives programme, we invite you to join a roundtable discussion on beneficial ownership transparency on Thursday, 24 February at 8:00 CET. The aim is to engage the extractive companies in a conversation about the importance of beneficial ownership transparency to companies, the challenges of disclosing beneficial ownership information, and how these are being addressed at the global and country levels.

On 7 September 2021, companies led by Anglo American, BHP, Glencore, Newmont, Repsol, and Rio Tinto signed a statement agreeing to voluntary beneficial ownership disclosures in line with the expectations for EITI supporting companies and expressing support for countriesâ€™ beneficial ownership transparency reforms in accord with the EITI Standard.

Indonesia and Philippines offer interesting similarities in regulatory frameworks for disclosing beneficial ownership information and in their experience attaining robust participation from extractive companies. Both countries present the need for private sector leadership alongside government and civil society to support beneficial ownership transparency reform.

This event will provide a platform for companies in Indonesia, Philippines, and those that operate in other Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) implementing countries to share examples of their initiatives related to beneficial ownership transparency, and to exchange insights on advancing beneficial ownership transparency within their existing mechanisms.
