On 30 July 2020 Open Ownership held our first technology showcase – an online webinar hosting talks by speakers from government, civil society, and the private sector – demonstrating technology working with beneficial ownership (BO) data. Over two hours, our speakers shared their projects, ranging from procurement red flag dashboards to commercial data platforms and national company registers.

The session was recorded and we are pleased to share the video for those who could not make it:

We found this set of talks particularly enlightening, as it highlighted some of the more technical work that is often overlooked when we talk about the benefits and challenges of implementing BO.

The showcase also demonstrated the wide variety of projects that are underway in this area, and how interconnected open data, government digital transformation, and non-governmental innovation are in solving transparency and corruption problems. Indeed, the most common theme from data users was on  interconnected  data sources and types of data. Open Ownership will be considering how to leverage all the showcased technical work for the public good. Do [let us know](mailto:tech@openownership.org) if you have any feedback on the event!

In detail our speakers were:

### Louise Crow - mySociety

Louise talked about mySociety’s recent work with the UK Government Digital Service’s Global Digital Marketplace Programme. Building [a dashboard](https://github.com/mysociety/bluetail) to identify red flags in procurement contracts by connecting them to BO data.

### Khairil Yusof - Sinar Project

Khairil showed us [Sinar’s Politikus project](https://politikus.sinarproject.org/), and the impact of using  the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS), Open Contracting Data Standard, and Popolo to power structured data collection through a traditional content management system.

### Friedrich Lindenberg - OCCRP

Friedrich demonstrated [OCCRP’s Aleph](https://aleph.occrp.org/) tool for investigative journalists, which includes BO data among many other sources and manages a knowledge graph through their Follow The Money ontology.

### Evgen Romanov - YouControl

Evgen gave a walkthrough of YouControl’s abilities to match people across different company data disclosures, for example, highlighting ultimate beneficial owners who have not been declared as such through techniques such as address matching.

### Larry Agoro - PesaFlow

Larry gave us a live demonstration of Kenya’s upcoming BO register from the perspective of a company filling out their declarations. He showed us the lengths the developers of the beneficial ownership register had gone to in order to validate the data.
