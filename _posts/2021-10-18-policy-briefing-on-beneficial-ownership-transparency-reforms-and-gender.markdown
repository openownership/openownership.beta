As a nascent policy area, the link between beneficial ownership transparency and gender is underexplored. To date, no comprehensive exploration of how beneficial ownership transparency reforms interact with gender – whether the positive impact of data use or potential negative unintended consequences of data publication – has taken place. 

In order to inform both Open Ownership’s own work and the wider work of beneficial ownership reformers and advocates around the world, we are seeking a contractor to conduct research and synthesise their findings in a policy briefing that explores how beneficial ownership transparency interacts with gender equality.

Applications for this work will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with interviews scheduled accordingly.
