- title: Technical assistance to implement beneficial ownership transparency
  icon: one-on-one
  text: "OO provides [targeted support](/resources/technical-assistance-with-implementation/)
    and quality assurance throughout [each stage](/guide) of the BOT implementation
    process. Working directly with national government agencies that are responsible
    for implementation, OO engages holistically with local and international stakeholders
    across and outside of government to ensure that reforms are well understood and
    supported, and that they respond to the needs of data users.\n\nThe OO team provides
    a range of support for implementers, including: developing and reviewing legislation
    and regulations; developing forms and business processes to collect data; designing
    and building technical systems to store and publish data; and analysing and using
    the resulting data. OO also works with implementers to support the creation of
    full economy central beneficial ownership registers as well as those for specific
    sectors such as [extractives](/extractives) and [procurement](/resources/beneficial-ownership-data-in-procurement/). "
- title: Technology and capacity to use beneficial ownership data
  icon: building
  text: OO works with governments, civil society, and companies to develop technology
    that uses beneficial ownership data to actively reduce corruption risks and improve
    governance. OO has developed the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS)](http://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/),
    which enables the publication of structured, linkable beneficial ownership data,
    as well as the [Global Open Ownership Register](https://register.openownership.org/),
    which uses real world beneficial ownership data for nearly 8 million companies
    and allows for public analysis and interrogation of the data. OO also provides
    direct support and training to people and organisations (including governments)
    wanting to understand and use beneficial ownership data. By providing technologies
    such as the BODS as public goods, OO aims to transform the availability of structured
    beneficial ownership data around the globe, going well beyond the implementation
    support provided directly to countries.
- title: Research to inform policy
  icon: sharing
  text: 'OO’s third workstream aims to further build the evidence base and produce
    the [guidance](/resources) and resources that help local stakeholders to implement
    effective BOT reforms. To do so, OO continues to collect evidence of implementation
    and impact from the team’s country work, guided by and informing the [Open Ownership
    Principles](/principles) (OO Principles), and sharing this knowledge and evidence
    with other national level stakeholders. It is important to research how to implement
    BOT effectively as well as why implementing BOT is necessary, as these questions
    underpin OO’s work at a national level and inform the development of data tools
    and technologies. This research is also a key mechanism through which OO can influence
    change across the world, by informing international standards and practices on
    BOT, and influencing the practice of intermediary organisations and consultants
    that support BOT implementations around the world. '
conclusion: If you are interested in partnering with Open Ownership to advance beneficial
  ownership transparency in your country, please contact <support@openownership.org>
  to discuss your country’s needs and the assistance we could provide.

Open Ownership (OO) believes that information on the true owners of companies is an essential part of a well-functioning economy and society. Public registers of beneficial owners give access to high quality data about who owns, controls, and benefits from companies and their profits. This information, known as beneficial ownership transparency (BOT), helps tackle corruption, reduce investment risk, and improve national and global governance.

OO helps countries generate high quality data on company ownership that complies with international standards and meets the needs of data users across government, civil society, and the private sector. OO supports people and organisations to use this data to build trust as well as reducing corruption and tax evasion.

Since 2017, OO has worked with almost [40 countries](/map/) to advance implementation of beneficial ownership reforms, as well as supporting the creation of over 15 new central and sectoral registers. OO has developed the world’s leading [data standard](http://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/) for beneficial ownership information, co-founded the international [Beneficial Ownership Leadership Group](/what-we-do/the-beneficial-ownership-leadership-group/), and built the world’s first [transnational public beneficial ownership register](https://register.openownership.org/).
