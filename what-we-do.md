- title: Guide to implementing beneficial ownership transparency
  icon: sharing
  text: Our implementation guide is designed to support governments that are considering or implementing beneficial ownership transparency. It provides practical resources, and shares the knowledge and good practice that is being developed by a growing number of countries around the world. We also hope it will be helpful for people in international institutions, the private sector and civil society who are supporting beneficial ownership transparency.

- title: Building a stable and trusted Beneficial Ownership Data Standard and user
    base
  icon: building
  text: The Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (the Standard, or BODS) is being developed
    in collaboration with dozens of international experts in company data and in technical
    standard-setting. It will enable the resulting beneficial ownership data to be
    interoperable, more easily reused, and higher quality. We are engaging with public
    and private sector publishers of beneficial ownership data to encourage uptake
    of the standard.

  text: The Beneficial Ownership Leadership Group came together in 2019 to drive the
    global policy shift towards free, open beneficial ownership data. By joining the
    Beneficial Ownership Leadership Group each country signs up to a   set of best

    Partnership, the group is comprised of Armenia, Kenya, Latvia, Mexico and the
    Slovak Republic.

- title: The OpenOwnership Register
  icon: one-on-one
  text: The Register is an easy-to-use, cloud-based, platform that links beneficial
    ownership information from multiple sources and makes it available for free to
    all, allowing for powerful global searches with just a couple of clicks. Data
    on the platform comes from regulatory sources such as national companies registers
    and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. It is also self-submitted
    by companies through our sleek, intuitive reporting interface. Information from
    more than 5 million companies is already available through the online portal.

    Register (and eventually our API) as part of their due diligence processes and
    to submit their ownership data to the Register. We are currently seeking early
    adopters to work with so that we can build a strong use case to build momentum.
