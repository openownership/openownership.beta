Steve Day is OpenOwnership’s Technical Lead. He is responsible for the practical side of our technology and technical advice to partners, as well as making sure that we are an integral part of the wider digital government and civic-technology community.

Before joining OpenOwnership, Steve led engineering efforts at civic-tech pioneers mySociety, working on a range of open-source projects from Freedom of Information to Parliamentary Monitoring. He also worked on digital transformation projects for the NHS, Medecins Sans Frontieres and various UK councils.

After a spell in a big data startup bringing data science to multi-million pound transport planning projects, the combination of data, technology and policy at OpenOwnership was too much to resist. Then began the steep learning curve of beneficial ownership transparency.

Steve has an MEng in Computer Science from Southampton University, specialising in human-computer interaction and machine learning. Born and raised in the Forest of Dean, you’ll now find him in Devon checking the surf forecast, or, if the waves are flat, with tools in hand making eco-improvements to his house.
