Louise Russell-Prywata is Open Ownershipâ€™s Director of Policy and Programmes. She manages technical assistance to governments implementing beneficial ownership transparency, and oversees the creation of our policy and thought leadership output.

Previously, Louise worked within and consulted for a variety of civil society organisations and international projects in the governance and anti-corruption space, most recently spending five years with Transparency International UK, serving as Head of Development. Here, Louise was instrumental to the development of work to reduce the role of the UK as a safe haven for international corruption, which resulted in new UK legal powers to investigate suspicious wealth.

Louise is also a Senior Atlantic Fellow at the London School of Economics, where her research interests include elite networks of financial influence and the role of company ownership data in tackling transnational governance issues. She is based in the UK, and holds an MSc in Inequalities and Social Science from the London School of Economics.
