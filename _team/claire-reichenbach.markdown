Claire Reichenbach is OpenOwnership’s Finance & Human Resources Director. She is responsible for the organisation's finances and the well-being of staff as well as ensuring that all runs smoothly behind the scenes.

Working in the international, non-profit sector her whole life, she spent over twelve years at Amnesty International. She has since taken her skills to various start-up charities in international children’s health and global education. Having until recently served as the Chair of the Board for AbleChildAfrica, she brings a governance perspective to her financial, operational and human resources non-profit experience.

Claire holds a BSc in Economics which she supplemented with further studies at the Birkbeck University of London, specialising in international development. She is fluent in French and is constantly working on improving her Spanish. Having lived and worked across Asia, Africa, Europe and Australia, she is now based in Canada (from where she is figuring out how to add Antarctica to the list!).
