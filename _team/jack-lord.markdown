Jack Lord works for Open Ownership’s technical partner, Open Data Services Co-operative. He provides implementation support to our partners, works on the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard and makes sure the policy and technology strands of our work remain linked together.

Having worked for many years with open economic data as a freelance researcher and then as data standards developer at Open Data Services Co-operative, Jack is well-placed to address the problem of creating accurate information about who owns companies. He maintains an active research profile and enjoys moving between the detail of implementation and the big picture of what beneficial ownership transparency means.

Jack has a PhD in West African history from SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies). Having grown up in England and Scotland, Jack now lives in Edinburgh.
