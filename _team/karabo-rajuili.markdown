Karabo Rajuili is Director of Country Programmes at Open Ownership, providing country support to governments implementing beneficial ownership transparency.
She comes with extensive experience with initiating and implementing
legislative and policy reforms to advance transparency and access to

Prior to joining Open Ownership, she worked for five years at award-winning

Coordinator.

In this capacity, using policy analysis, research, parliamentary engagement
and strategic public interest litigation, she worked to secure information rights
in the interest of investigative journalism and, wherever possible, the wider
public, on an array of policy areas including cyber security, digital rights,
the intersection of privacy and access to information laws and beneficial
ownership transparency in procurement law reform.

She also worked on the most recent review of the Companies Act in South
Africa, and was part of successful efforts to advocate for and subsequently
draft South Africaâ€™s first political party financial transparency law.

While at amaBhungane, she served as country chair and regional support

IFRA) Media Freedom Committees in South Africa, Uganda and Kenya,
working with senior journalists and editors in print, digital and broadcast
media.

She has published numerous comment and analysis pieces on topics
including freedom of expression, transparency and privacy rights.

KwaZulu-Natal, is an alumnus of the International Peace and Security Institute
(IPSI) through which she completed a graduate course in Public International
Law at Leiden University, as well as an alumnus of the African School of
