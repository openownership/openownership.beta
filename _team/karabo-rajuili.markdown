the intersection of privacy and access to information laws and beneficial
ownership transparency in procurement law reform.

She also worked on the most recent review of the Companies Act in South
Africa, and was part of successful efforts to advocate for and subsequently
draft South Africa’s first political party financial transparency law.

While at amaBhungane, she served as country chair and regional support
