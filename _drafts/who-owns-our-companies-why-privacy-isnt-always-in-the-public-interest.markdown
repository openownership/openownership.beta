description: We're excited to announce the launch of a new research report, 'Privacy
  or Public Interest? Making the Case for Public Information on Company Ownership.'
  We produced the report in partnership with The B Team and The Engine Room.  It considers
  the legal implications of public beneficial ownership data to the public, evaluated
  from both the perspective of the companies holding that information and the authorities
  requiring it to be disclosed publicly, and the relationship with data protection
  and privacy laws.

We're excited to announce the launch of a new research report, ['](https://manage.siteleaf.com/documents/5c9bbe0928cf9a49acdce5ed/edit)[Privacy or Public Interest? Making the Case for Public Information on Company Ownership](https://www.openownership.org/uploads/oo-data-protection-and-privacy.pdf)[.'](https://manage.siteleaf.com/documents/5c9bbe0928cf9a49acdce5ed/edit) We produced the report in partnership with [The B Team](http://www.bteam.org/) and [The Engine Room](https://www.theengineroom.org/).  It considers the legal implications of public beneficial ownership data to the public, evaluated from both the perspective of the companies holding that information and the authorities requiring it to be disclosed publicly, and the relationship with data protection and privacy laws.

We've summarised the findings of this report in my [Huffington Post article](http://), which explores why publicly accessible central registers for beneficial ownership information are a force for public good and how the disclosure of beneficial ownership can be readily accommodated alongside data protection and other relevant obligations. It also considers how in doing so, we can ensure that privacy considerations are respected and mitigate potential risks.

We'd love to hear your views on this pertinent issue.
