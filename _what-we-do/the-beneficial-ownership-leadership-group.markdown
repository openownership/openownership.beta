intro: |-
  The Beneficial Ownership Leadership Group came together in 2019 to drive the
  global policy shift towards free, open beneficial ownership data. By joining the
  Beneficial Ownership Leadership Group each country signs up to a set of best
  practice disclosure principles. Convened by OpenOwnership and [Open Government
  Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/), the group is comprised of
  Armenia, Kenya, Latvia, Mexico, Norway, Nigeria, Slovak Republic and the United Kingdom.

  Governments increasingly recognise the value of beneficial ownership
  transparency for promoting effective governance and efficient markets. It
  builds market confidence and helps businesses manage risk, facilitates
  effective taxation, helps save money on schools and hospitals, and tackles
  corruption.

principles: |-
  - Publishing company beneficial ownership data that is freely downloadable,
    searchable, and reusable by the public, without a fee, proprietary software,
    or the need for registration.
  - Implementing progressively ambitious best practice in beneficial ownership
    transparency, across technical, legislative, regulatory, and administrative
    parameters.
  - Committing resources to enable improvements and iterations to data quality and
    standardisation.
  - Contributing to the building of best practice, including by recognising the
    evolving illicit finance threat and considering implementing beneficial
    ownership transparency beyond companies to a wider group of assets classes.
  - Working in partnership with civil society and enabling their role as watchdogs
    and users of the data.
  - Engaging other partners, including governments and international institutions,
    to advance the objective of making beneficial ownership transparency a global
    norm; and
  - Contributing to evaluation and impact assessment of our shared approach.

  By joining the Leadership Group, governments publicly signal their intention to adhere to the following principles on beneficial ownership data disclosure (note: these do not represent legally-binding commitments for signatory states).
